title: "About Me"

Hi! My name is Priyam, and I'm a 17-year old who loves computer science and robotics!

In my free time, I'm probably reading a book, playing video games with my friends, or out camping with my Boy Scout troop! Check out what I've made on my [projects](/projects.html) page or look at my GitHub for new WIPs!
